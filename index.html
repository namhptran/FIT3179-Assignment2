        <h2>Rwandan Genocide (1994)</h2>
        <p>
            Rwanda has an 85% Hutu ethnic majority, but their history has long been dominated by the Tutsi minority.
            In 1990, the Tutsi monarchy was overthrown which lead to a civil war between the Hutus and Tutsis.
            Following the crash of the Hutu presidential plane in 1994, Hutu extremists blamed the event on the Tutsi.
            They then lead a campaign of slaughter against the Tutsi population over 100 days, where neighbours were
            killed by neighbours, and thousands of Tutsi women were kidnapped into sex slavery.

        <h2>Syrian Civil War (2011 - present)</h2>
        <p>
            The Syrian Civil War began in 2011 following a series of protests against the Assad regime commonly known
            as the Arab Spring. The protests were met with violence by the Syrian government, which led to a civil war.

        <h2>Afghan Conflicts (1991 - present)</h2>
        <p>
            Afghanistan has been in a perpetual state of conflict since 1978. These conflicts follow the Taliban's rise
            to power during the Afghan Civil War, followed by the removal of the Taliban in 2001 by NATO forces as
            part of the war on terror, and then NATO's subsequent retreat in 2021. Conflict continues to this day
            between
            the formerly NATO-backed Islamic State of Afghanistan and the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
